This simple project is a control a DC motor with the L293D integrated circuit and an Arduino Nano clone:
- A touch switch changes the direction of rotation 🌀 of the motor.
- A 10k potentiometer regulates the motor speed 🔘.
- An OLED display shows the motor speed (in percentage) and an arrow ⬅️➡️ indicates the direction of rotation.
